Pericardial effusion-thickening was not observed. Thoracic esophageal calibration was normal and no significant tumoral wall thickening was detected. No enlarged lymph nodes in prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal or bilateral hilar-axillary pathological dimensions were detected. When examined in the lung parenchyma window; In the lower lobes of both lungs, subpleural areas of ground glass density were observed. Pleural effusion-thickening was not detected. Upper abdominal organs included in the sections are normal. No space-occupying lesion was detected in the liver that entered the cross-sectional area. Bilateral adrenal glands were normal and no space-occupying lesion was detected. Bone structures in the study area are natural.",
